**DIAGNOSIS:**

In this bug, the issue is that `console.log()` on objects that are array-like returns arrays. For instance, if one tries to `console.log({0:10})`, the answer would be `[10]` instead of `{0:10}`. This is confusing to developers and would be very helpful to fix the bug such that `console.log()` returns objects when objects are passed instead of modifying them into arrays. This would also be consistent with other browsers such as google chrome.The function `pseudoArray()` in the previewers.js file under the object folder checks for objects that qualify as pseudo arrays and returns true so that such objects are converted to arrays.This function needs to be removed to fix the bug.The tests for this feature are in the file `test_objectgrips-array-like-object.js` under unit tests in the server folder in devtools. After fixing the bug, the existing tests for this feature need to be removed from the code.These tests are in `test_objectgrips-array-like-object.js`.The file `/devtools/server/tests/unit/xpcshell.ini` should also be modified to stop running tests on this feature.
                                  
**SOLUTION:**

To fix this bug, I have removed the `pseudoArray()` function so that objects are no longer converted into arrays. I have also removed the tests that relate to this feature.The tests are removed by deleting the file `server/tests/unit/test_objectgrips-array-like-object.js` under the devtools folder.The file `/devtools/server/tests/unit/xpcshell.ini` is also modified to stop running tests that relate to the feature.
                                  
                                  
 **TESTING:**
 * Run `./mach build` to confirm that the code still builds without errors.
 * Run `./mach test ...` to confirm that the changes didn't lead to test failures.
